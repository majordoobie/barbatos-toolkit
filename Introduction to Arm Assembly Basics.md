# Introduction to Arm Assembly Basics

The series is focused on the basics of ARM with the perspective of writting shell code for the platform [^Azeria]

- ARM is a RISC (reduced instruction set computing) but with their own licensing. So while ARM requires licensing fees to use their IP RISCV has no restrictions [^RISCV_About]

Advantages and disadvantages 
- unlike Intel, ARM has 100 or less instructions and more general purpose registers [^Azeria]
- Unlike x86, ARM is big-endian with the option of switching making it BI-Endian 
- ARM also has two modes, ARM mode and Thumb mode 

ARM versions
