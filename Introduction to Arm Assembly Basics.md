# Introduction to Arm Assembly Basics

The series is focused on the basics of ARM with the perspective of writting shell code for the platform [^Azeria]

- ARM is a RISC (reduced instruction set computing) but with their own licensing. So while ARM requires licensing fees to use their IP RISCV has no restrictions [^RISCV_About]

Advantages and disadvantages 
- unlike Intel, ARM has 100 or less instructions and more general purpose registers [^Azeria]
- Unlike x86, ARM is big-endian with the option of switching making it [[BI-Endian]] 
- ARM also has two modes, ARM mode and Thumb mode 

ARM versions [^Azeria]

## What is assembly 
- assembly is a thin layer of syntax on top of machine code which is composed of instructions 
- to be able to write assembly you need a program to convert the assembly language to machine code. An example of that is the gnu assembler. We will then need to link it which probably adds a runtime if I am not mistaken. 
```bash
as program.s -o program.o
ld program.o -o program
```

The code above is automatically accomplished by a compiler

```bash
gcc program.c -o program 
```

## Assembly Syntax
The syntax of assembly is broken down into `mnemonics` `operand` for example 
```armasm
MOV R1, R2
```


## Data Types
Just like HLL there are different data types that ARM operations work on. The data types are signed or unsigned `words`, `havewords` and `bytes` [^Azeria]
![[Pasted image 20231207143047.png]]
These data types of extentios associated with them being `-h` or `sh` for halfwords, `b` or `sb` for bytes and no extension for words

Example of how these are used:
```
ldr = Load Word
ldrh = Load unsigned Half Word
ldrsh = Load signed Half Word
ldrb = Load unsigned Byte
ldrsb = Load signed Bytes

str = Store Word
strh = Store unsigned Half Word
strsh = Store signed Half Word
strb = Store unsigned Byte
strsb = Store signed Byte
```

## Endianness
Endianness is the byte-order in which each byte of an object is stored in memory. Little-endian (LE) like x86 is stored where the **least-significant-byte** is stored at the lowest address. Addresses typically grow from bottom to top, were the bottom is the lowest address. Therefore, in little-endian the bytes flow in the oder from bottom to top.

Big-endian on the other hand is the other way around and it is the preferred byte-order of networking data.

Before ARMv3, the architecture was little-endian, since then it has become [[BI-Endian]]. On ARMv6, the instructions are **fixed little-endian** while the **data access** can be either little-endian or big-endian as controlled by bit 9, the **E bit** of the **Program Status Register (CPSR)**

## Registers
The amount of registers depends on the ARM version. According to the ARM reference Manual [^ARM_Manual] there are **30 general-purpose 32-bit registers**. The first 16 registers are accessible in the **user-level mode**. The additional registers are available in privilege software execution.

**R0-R12** can be used during common operations toÂ store temporary values, pointers, etc. **R0** for example can be referred as **accumulator** during the arithmetic operations. The calling convention of ARM specifies that the first four registers must be used for the first four paramters to a function call

**R13: SP** the stack pointer points to the top of the stack. The stack is an area of memory used for function-specific storage, which is reclaimed when the function returns. The stack pointer is therefor used for allocating space on the stack, by subtracting the values in bytes we want to allocate from the stack pointer. In other words, if we want to allocate a 32 bit value, we subtract 4 from the stack pointer.

**R14: LR (Link register)** When a function call is made, the link register gets updated with a memory address referencing the next instruction where the function was initiated from. Doing this allows the program to return to the "parent" function initiated by the "child".

**R15: PC (Program Counter)** The Program Counter is automatically incremented by the size of the instruction executed. This size is always 4 bytes in ARM state and 2 bytes in THUMB mode. When a branch instruction is being executed, the PC holds the destination address. During execution, PC stores the address of the current instruction plus 8 (two ARM instructions) in ARM state, and the current instruction plus 4 (two Thumb instructions) in Thumb(v1) state. This is different from x86 where PC always points to the next instruction to be executed.


# ARM32 vs [[ARMv8 AArch64]]
The examples in the Azeria guide are in ARM32 which is causing issues with my understanding. I am going to pivot into a AArch64 specific guide first to learn the basics then go back to writting shell code.

Reasons to learn assembly include:
- Writing out the Boot/Reset Sequence for a CPU
- Writing out CPU-specific specialized tasks
- Further enhance performance
- Understanding a specific CPU as much as possible
- Exploits/Hacks for a specific CPU (such as for Video Game Consoles)
- A better Understanding of "under the hood" stuff (such as Memory Management, Cache, etc)
