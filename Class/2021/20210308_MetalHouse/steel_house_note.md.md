## Training
### Introduction
- Scripting allows new line limited cli commands to automatically configure your targets
- Always double check that the modules are doing what you think they are doing since they are not vetted by the framework developer 
- Metal House can be used to just throw stuff and you catch it somewhere else
- To display what each payload does, you can do `payload list` or could use `payload <payload> show` to get general descriptions 
- Enabling a target sets the current context to that target
- Chain disable are the targets and payloads
