- Thread of Execution - smallest unit of programming command (code)
- More than one thread can execute per process sharing the same resource 
- Threads are independent component of computation 
- ==Multithreading== - happens when multiple cores are involved or when time-slicing is used

- ==theading.activeCount()== returns the number of active thread objects in the program
- ==theading.currentThread()== number of thread objects in the current thread control
